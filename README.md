# 🏨 Hotel Room Price and Revenue Prediction

# 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict hotel room prices and estimate future revenue based on historical booking and hotel feature data.
It provides valuable insights for dynamic pricing strategies, maximizing occupancy rates, and boosting hotel profitability.

# 🚀 Project Workflow
**Data Collection:** Importing historical booking datasets.

**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, data type corrections, and removing outliers.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Analyzing booking patterns, cancellations, customer types, and price distributions.

**Feature Engineering:**
Creating new features like stay length, seasonality indicators, and customer segmentation.

**Model Building:**
Training and testing regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict prices.

**Evaluation:**
Validating model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
**Python**

**Pandas**

**NumPy**

**Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)**

**Scikit-learn (ML models and evaluation)**

# 📊 Key Outcomes
Successfully predicted hotel room prices based on multiple features.

Identified key factors influencing pricing (e.g., booking season, customer type, room type).

Created revenue forecasts to help in financial planning and marketing strategies.


# ✨ Future Work
Deploy the model as a web application (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit).

Improve model accuracy using ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).

Implement real-time price optimization.
